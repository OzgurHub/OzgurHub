I generated a CSV file in Excel and ensured that the student names and subject headings also matched up. I wrote and ran the Python code in VS Code, an infinite loop for accepting data input and outputting grades. The Process_Data. The main code in the py file ran without bugs and I tested the error handling thoroughly for entering non-numeric expressions. The program correctly guided the user to input numerical grades or to exit the procedure. This task really challenged my problem-solving and inductive thinking, and taught me to value research and self-study techniques; it helped me improve on my road to knowledge.
